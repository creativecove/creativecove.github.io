			<h3> What is this website? </h3>
			<p> The website before you is a collection of different things, all wrapped up into one big portfolio of a webpage. It has information about projects, both current and past, it has some of my favorite games and highlights from all through out, it has a selection of different music I've listened to, and it even has a map to a wonderful fishing spot. I do also have a form to fill out once you feel you are ready to answer it. </p>
