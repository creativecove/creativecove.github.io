			<h2> List of Personal Projects </h2>
			<p> The following is a complete list of all projects I'm currently working on or plan on continuing within the future. </p>
			<br>
			<h4>Chaotic Additions</h4>
			<p class="left"> Chaotic Additions is a small mod for Minecraft I've had in the works for a while. I'm planning on completely restarting the project from scratch, since I had began creating it in the incorrect version anyway, but more so because I wanted to fully think through the features within the mod rather then just following the tutorial without any clear idea of what my goal was going to be. In the end, I'm very likely going to end up changing everything from the textures used to the very name itself, but it hopefully won't stray too far from the original idea I had before this. The only major hope besides that is that I actually start and finish it before I get a job, or at least am able to handle working on it in the background. </p>

			<h4>Descent</h4>
			<p class="left"> Descent is a small game I've been working on. Although I have a few plans for it, I'm currently leaving it alone. Due to the lack of progress I've made on it, I have very little to say on it or the processes behind it, everything is going fine, I just need to properly plan out the process I'm going to use to make it. </p>
